Churn in the telecom industry is inevitable, and expensive. Prediction of the telecom customers who are likely to exit the contract
Telecom companies in India have a business problem with customer retention. The companies observed that alarming number of customers exit when their contracts expire while it is getting increasingly difficult to acquire new customers. It is a market reality that Telecom companies are battling to attract each other's customers while retaining their own. Thus, Customer churn reduction is the central concern of most telecom companies as switching costs to the customer are low and acquisition cost to the company is high. Churn reduces profitability as it means potential loss of future revenue and also losing the invested costs of acquisition. So a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn by designing new plans and discounts etc.
